# Data-Encrypter-Decrypter

Introduction:
The project is a messaging application developed using Python's tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The primary objective of this application is to enable secure message exchange through encryption and decryption mechanisms.

Purpose:
To create a secure messaging system where messages can be encrypted and decrypted for confidentiality.
